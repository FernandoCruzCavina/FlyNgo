## Notes
In this project, i decided to create a travel planning website, because i wanted learn more about to React with TypeScript through basic database-aligned post, put, delete, get themes.

In the middle way, i had worry about frontend part, so i learn about **_Tailwind_** and **_PostCSS_** to make a interface quickly.

Indeed, i noticed i need to build responsive websites for more accessibility
